THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR TIME AND READING THIS :)

This is a very simple working model of a G-Code interpreter. G-Code are the commands used in CNC (Computer Numeric Control) manufacturing.

The G-Code gives details to the machine on how to process the raw material in order to obtain a highly precised component.

The program accepts user-input G-Code lines, extracts 2D coordinates, stores them in a matrix, and calculates the total number of moves and toolpath distance.

Itâ€™s designed to process linear move commands and provide clear output for CNC toolpath analysis.

The interpreter prompts users to enter G-Code lines (e.g., G01 X0 Y0) interactively, stopping when the user types "done".

It supports commands G01 to G05, treating them as linear moves. Each line is parsed to extract X and Y coordinates, which are stored in a matrix as [x, y] lists. 

The program calculates the Euclidean distance between consecutive points to determine the total toolpath length. Invalid inputs, such as non-numeric coordinates or malformed commands, are skipped with warning messages, ensuring robust operation.
